The "CC_config" file has been altered so that it is textually updatable,
eliminating the need for Janet, Annette, or Eric to patch the file.
Each entry in the file consists of a KEYWORD and ARGUMENT(S). Below is the
current list of keywords and valid arguments:

message:       <string>

     Sets the daily welcome message to <string>.

holes:         <date/time>

     Sets the holes to open at <date/time>. If <date/time> is in the past,
     the holes will default to open. Example is "90-11-12_21:00:00"

password:      <string>

     Sets the current door password to <string>. There may be 10 passwords.
     The first password encountered in the Config file is set to password 1.
     Subsequent passwords are set to 2 through 10. The magic_data field of
     the switch used determines which password will open the associated door.

guard:         <roster>, <region #>

     This guards <region #> with the roster <roster> which is four bytes.
     The "member_edit" program is used to grant people access. Caribe does
     not look at the status of a member, just that their name is on the
     roster and their expiration date has not passed.

actions:        <entry proc number>, <action type>, arg1 [, arg2 [, arg3]]

     <entry proc number> is the entry proc that will adopt this particular
     action. Entry proc values are set with twiddle. (set Entry_proc = #)

     Action types are as follows:

     color,    <color 1>, <color 2>

          Sets the avatar's custom colors to <color 1> and <color 2>.

          <color 1> = (LEG PATTERN (0 - 15)  x 16)  + TORSO PATTERN (0 - 15)
          <color 2> = (ARM PATTERN (0 - 15)  x 16)

          To turn someone nude, use PINK (2), which equates to:
               <color 1> = (2 x 16) + 2, or 34
               <color 2> = (2 x 16)    , or 32

          To RESTORE SOMEONE'S ORIGINAL (TRUE) COLORS, use 255 for each
          argument.  (color, 255, 255)

     moonwalk, <yes/no>

          If set to yes (must be lowercase), people will start to moonwalk
          from this point forward. If set to no, people will cease to
          moonwalk. Maybe you could use this in a disco environment.

     head,     <head #>

          Set the avatar's head style to <head #>. If <head #> is 0, then
          the avatar will revert to TRUE_HEAD_STYLE.

     body,     <body type>

          Set the avatar's body type to <body type>. 0 = human, 1-6 = custom.

     sex,      <male/female>

          Set the avatar's gender accordingly. male or female must be all
          lowercase.

     tallness, <tallness factor(0-15)>

          Set the avatar's height. 0 = TALLEST, 15 = SHORTEST.
          ** THIS IS NOT REVERSABLE **

EXAMPLES:

actions:  3, color, 34, 32
actions:  3, moonwalk, yes
actions:  3, head, 142
actions:  3, sex, female
actions:  3, tallness, 15
