# Club Caribe Historical Source

This GitHub repository contains recovered server source code for Quantum Links Club Caribe virtual world which operated from July 1989 until February 21st 1994 on the Quantum Link service for Commodore 64 users.

This code was discovered in an archive of Quantum Link files that date to the 2010's and have original last modified file dates that corroborate with the end of the service. Therefore, this is the final release version of the Club Caribe server source code.

It's currently unclear whether the server source code is complete in its entirety, however we have the full original [Lucasfilm's Habitat server source code](https://github.com/Museum-of-Art-and-Digital-Entertainment/habitat/tree/master/sources/stratus) which the Caribe source is based upon so we can compare.

To make seeing the changes made easier, I have recreated the directory layout of the Habitat server source and only added files for which we have a Caribe version of. You should be able to look at the commit history to see changes made. Some files were condensed down into one file instead of many and so you'll see that in the history too.

Without a Stratus VOS operating system and compatible machine, it's currently impossible to run in its current state anyhow. Habitat and Club Caribe were tightly integrated into the Quantum Link technology stack and you'd need to also have that running to be able to utilise the code seen here.

This source code is mostly presented just for historical purposes but somebody could take the changes here and create a fork of the [NeoHabitat project](https://github.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat) to add them in and have a functional Caribe style server.

## TODO

- Ascertain if the server source code is incomplete
- Compare changes between original [Lucasfilm's Habitat server source code](https://github.com/Museum-of-Art-and-Digital-Entertainment/habitat/tree/master/sources/stratus)
- Document changes between original [Lucasfilm's Habitat server source code](https://github.com/Museum-of-Art-and-Digital-Entertainment/habitat/tree/master/sources/stratus)
- Implement missing behaviors into the [NeoHabitat project](https://github.com/frandallfarmer/neohabitat)  under a seperate Caribe fork possibly
